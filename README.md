# How to Convert a Uniform Distribution to a Gaussian Distribution

The TrueRNGv2/3 and many other random number generators often provide a uniform distribution output. This means that you are getting a binary file where each bit has an equal probability of being a zero or one.  Some applications need a gaussian distribution.  

This code is an example of how to convert from a uniform to a gaussian distribution.
